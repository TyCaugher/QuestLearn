## QuestLearn is a classroom reward management site to reward students for good habits in the classroom, both online and in-person.

QuestLearn is a gamified classroom build at a supplement to existing teaching styles and formats, rather than requiring teachers to adapt their ciriculum to the system.  QuestLearn provides the ability to create a classroom economy, rewarding coins (QC) to students for achieving good grades, good habits, or any teacher-defined criteria.
- Full Google Classroom support
- Students can redeem coins for cosmetics, classroom rewards, or custom rewards.
